# Js-form-data-assigner
This is a recursive function which generates a formData object from nested values. When our formData is a huge nested object it becomes really hard to append to a FormData Object. Also, when handling dynamic form objects it's a pain in the ***. Use this simple Assigner which takes care of all these problems for you and returns a nice and formatted formData object with all appended values
 
## Instructions
Go to the src folder and download the formDataAssigner.js file.
Voila! Now use it in your production exactly how you like. :)

### Testing
Run this command: ``npm run test`` or ``yarn test``
